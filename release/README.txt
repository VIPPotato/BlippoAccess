BlippoAccess
Accessibility mod for Blippo+

REQUIREMENTS
- Blippo+
- MelonLoader (install first): https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader.Installer/releases
- Screen reader (NVDA recommended; JAWS supported through Tolk)

INSTALLATION
1. Install MelonLoader for Blippo+.
2. Start the game once and close it. This creates required MelonLoader folders.
3. Copy files from this ZIP:
   - Copy mods\BlippoAccess.dll into your game Mods folder.
   - Copy Tolk.dll into the game root folder (same folder as Blippo+.exe).
   - Copy nvdaControllerClient64.dll into the game root folder.
   - (Optional) Keep nvdaControllerClient32.dll only if you need 32-bit NVDA client compatibility.
   - Copy UserData\Loader.cfg into the game UserData folder (merge/overwrite) to hide the MelonLoader console.
4. Launch the game.

TROUBLESHOOTING
- If speech does not work, confirm Tolk.dll and nvdaControllerClient64.dll are in the game root folder.
- If the mod is not loaded, check MelonLoader\Latest.log for errors.
